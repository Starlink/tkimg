I'm happy to announce version 1.4 of the "tkImg" package
(formerly known as 'Img").

This package enhances Tk, adding support for many other Image formats.

Changes compared to version 1.3.x:

-  New formats: DTED, RAW.
-  indexing TIFF images is now possible [Feature Request #706277]
-  No longer works with Tk 8.2 and earlier.
-  Support for Tk 8.5's PhotoPutblock functions,
   which no longer panic when out-of-memory
-  Will build correctly on more platforms (TEA upgraded
   to version 3.7 and autoconf upgraded to version 2.65
-  upgrade to zlib 1.2.5, libpng-1.4.3, libtiff-3.9.4, libjpeg-8b

This version only works with Tcl/Tk 8.3 or higher (tested up to
8.6b1). If you are using Tk8.2 or lower, please stick with tkImg1.3
(which is still available).

Currently there are three identical source distributions:
	tkimg14.zip             (for Windows)	(about 7.4 Mb)
	tkimg1.4.tar.gz         (for Unix)	(about 6.6 Mb)
	tkimg1.4.tar.bz2        (for Unix)	(about 4.9 Mb)

All these files can be downloaded from:
	http://source.net/project/tkimg/

The most recent info is always available at:
	http://source.net/project/tkimg/

See the README on how to build and use the packages.

For PNG, JPEG and TIFF support the supporting packages have to be
build and installed. See the file README for more in-depth
explanations.

For postscript you need Ghostscript (version 2.6 or higher) to be
available on your system.
